  My Trip Around the USA on a Segway
Segway'n USA
Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!
<h2>August.20.2012</h2>

   <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way:
<ol> 
  <li>Walla Walla,WA</li>
  <li>Magic City,ID</li>
  <li>Bountiful,UT</li>
  <li>Last Chance,CO</li>
  <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
  <li>Why, AZ</li>
  </ol>
<h2>July 4, 2012</h2>
 <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
     <br>
     <br>
 <q>Passing cars, <br>
  When you can't see, <br>
  May get you, <br>
  A glimpse,<br>
  Of eternity.<br>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.

   <p>
  My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
<ul>
  <li>cellphone</li>
  <li>iPod</li>
  <li>digital camera</li>
  <li> protein bar</li>
  <br>
  </ul>
Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
